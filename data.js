    description: "I'm an AI researcher in <a href='https://telepix.net/' target='_blank'>TelePIX</a>. My research seeks to solve real-world problems from an artificial intelligence perspective. I address challenging tasks such as complex image restoration and data-efficient learning for few-shot segmentation by applying generative models (diffusion-based, score-based, translation models). In parallel, my work explores continuous signal modeling using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for applications in neural image compression and spatial-spectral super-resolution. Recently, my research interest has shifted towards Vision-Language Models (VLMs). My primary goal is to build a unified model capable of solving various complex tasks in earth science"
